# Density cannot be dropped from a full strategic gap-closing claim

This sparse even losing ancestor has a genuine winning residual opening above
every exact-deficit block. The corresponding continuing gap pick still loses.
Its missing-counter budget violates the density threshold; it is not an H or C counterexample.
