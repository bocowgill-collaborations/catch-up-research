# The immediate-successor reply can lose at an actual drawn interval endpoint

This finite diagnostic is reached by core pick four and opponent pick eleven
at N=15. It certifies the endpoint and every first pick, without evaluating
the full core root or asserting a counterexample to the interval conjecture.
