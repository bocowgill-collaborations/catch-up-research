# Alternating odd/even tails can still lose at deficit one

The generated private proof DAG shares exact W/L subpositions. Every LOSS node
covers every legal pick; every WIN node supplies one legal winning pick.
Small leaves replay the proved executable evaluator in the kernel.
This sparse alternating tail is not an interval and proves no legal reachability claim.
