# An obstruction to upper-only exact-sum descent

At opening `m+4`, every exact block that permits only original upper witnesses
must be `{4,m}`. The next structurally permitted opening `m+3` admits no
such block. These statements hold for every `m ≥ 6` and `k ≥ 2`.

This is a restriction on a precisely specified proof grammar. It does not say
that the permitted branch is actually losing, nor that uniform nonloss is false.
Additional semantic exclusions or lower-witness repairs are outside this grammar.
