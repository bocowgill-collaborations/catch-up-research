# Catch-Up one-sided strategy extraction

This research module extracts a deterministic one-sided non-loss strategy DAG from the complete
solved graph produced by `CatchUp.Earlier.ExactSolver`. At the strategy owner's nodes it retains one safe
move; at the opponent's nodes it retains every legal move.

The extractor trusts the solved graph's annotations. Its output is therefore untrusted certificate
data, not a proof of `CatchUp.CanAvoidLoss`. A later independent checker will recompute legality,
transitions, terminal outcomes, and acyclic progress.

/--
Select the certificate branch at one solved node and return the moves that must be traversed.

This function checks the solver's annotations for internal consistency but is not the independent
certificate checker: in particular, it consumes the solver's precomputed child states and outcomes.
