# An alternative exact-sum block defends a near-maximum deficit

If counter `b` is available and a separate block also sums to `b`, a hypothetical
loss at deficit `b` forces a genuine residual winning opening above `b+a`, where
`a>0` is any lower bound on the counters. Thus an upper bound `b+a` rules out loss.

The block can have arbitrary cardinality. A sufficiently large member can end a
legal midpoint turn, replacing the complementary pair used previously.
Every opponent reply is retained; neither parity nor interval structure is needed.
