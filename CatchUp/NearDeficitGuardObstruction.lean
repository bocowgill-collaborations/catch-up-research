# A counter one below the deficit does not guarantee safety

The sparse parent loses despite even effective total and an available counter
one below its deficit. Inserting counter two turns it into a win.
The proof DAG retains every losing-node choice and correct same-player continuations.
This is an obstruction to proposed induction lemmas, not to the interval conjecture.
