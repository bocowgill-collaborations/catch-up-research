# A dense obstruction to mandatory entry through an exact block

This finite diagnostic satisfies the dense subsum-gap branch hypotheses, but neither member
of its maximal exact block is a safe first pick in the continuing state. The continuing state
is drawn, with a unique safe first pick. All values below use the executable/value bridge.
