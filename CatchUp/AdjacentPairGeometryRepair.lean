# Geometric adjacent-pair repairs

For an orphan `a` beside `{b,b+1}`, the plus-one deficit always draws.
The minus-one deficit draws exactly when `b ≥ 2*a-1`; below that threshold
it wins. The proofs track each legal pick and use only two-counter endgames.

Consequently two adjacent pairs form a drawn tied root. Three adjacent pairs
with minimum at least three are nonwinning, and they draw when the second
pair starts at least `2*a-1`. This does not prove an arbitrary-pair-count
invariant or the unbounded first-pair endpoint.
