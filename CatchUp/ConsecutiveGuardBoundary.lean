# A near-maximum defense excludes the top six large first picks

A hypothetical winning pick on `{3,4} ∪ Icc 9 N` supplies a residual losing
opening at least four labels higher. Continuing with counter three exposes a
position covered by `NearMaximumDefense` if fewer than six labels remain above
the original pick. This gives an unbounded interval restriction, without parity.

No residual winning opening is promoted to the original support, and the value
of the full position is not determined here.
