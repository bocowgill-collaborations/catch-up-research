# A sparse obstruction to the unrestricted two-anchor double-loss claim

The generated private proof DAG shares exact W/L subpositions. Every LOSS node
covers every legal pick; every WIN node supplies one legal winning pick.
Small leaves replay the proved executable evaluator in the kernel.
This is not a counterexample to the interval conjecture or the anchor-eight claim.
