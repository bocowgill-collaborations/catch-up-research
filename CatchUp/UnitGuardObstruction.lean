# A minimum counter of two does not ensure safety at deficit one

The twelve-counter sparse support has minimum two and odd counter sum,
yet loses at unit deficit. Every legal first pick is certified losing.
The proof DAG retains every losing-node choice and correct same-player continuations.
This is an obstruction to proposed induction lemmas, not to the interval conjecture.
