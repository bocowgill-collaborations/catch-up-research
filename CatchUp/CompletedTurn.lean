# Completed Catch-Up turns

This module gives both an ordered trace and an exact unordered finite-set characterization of one
completed Catch-Up turn. It permits turn-level arguments to reason about chosen subsets and their
sums while retaining a proof that every pick is a legal game step. It also flattens the primitive
minimax recursion across a whole completed turn, both as traces and as legal subsets.

/--
An ordered trace of exactly one completed post-opening turn.

The `more` constructor records a pick that leaves the mover strictly behind. The `finish`
constructor records the unique final pick, which catches up or ties. Availability is checked at
every pick; nonterminality will follow from completion and is proved below.
