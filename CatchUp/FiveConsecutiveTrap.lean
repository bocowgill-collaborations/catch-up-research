# A Reachable Five-Consecutive-Counter Trap in Catch-Up

Five consecutive counters beginning at least at `4` form a first-player win when play begins tied.
Nevertheless, in every interval game of size `4 * k`, `k ≥ 2`, a legal history after opening `3`
reaches exactly the tied top five counters with player one to move. This gives an infinite family of
reachable winning traps for block-clearing strategies; it does not assert that optimal play must
enter the trap.
