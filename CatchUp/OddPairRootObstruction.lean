# An even number of odd-start adjacent pairs can have a winning root

This sparse six-pair support has a winning root with opening four.
The opponent LOSS child retains every legal reply. No uniqueness is claimed.
The proof DAG retains every losing-node choice and correct same-player continuations.
This is an obstruction to proposed induction lemmas, not to the interval conjecture.
