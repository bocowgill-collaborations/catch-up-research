# The high-level Catch-Up counterexample search

A state is the next integer to examine. `next` either halts or advances by one. `runFor` is a
bounded observation of this transition system, not a total definition of its unbounded search.
One transition contains a total finite game evaluation. No resource timeout is a game outcome.
